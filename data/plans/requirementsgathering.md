# Plan for requirements gathering interviews

## Introduction

- Interview should be casual and open discussion should be encouraged
    - If useful conversation flows naturally this should be explored above sticking to the plan
- At the start of the interview greet the participant and start the recording
- Go over the reason for the interview (requirements gathering) and reiterate that the participant can ask for a break or withdraw from the interview at any time

## Interview

- Give a vague description of the project:
    - What the project will be (a website builder for rental properties)
    - How the project will be approached due to the constraints of the course (as a separate site first, with intent to integrate more closely with freetobook in future)
- From your perspective, what is the most important thing to get out of this project in the long term? What makes it significant?
- What do you know about existing website builder services?
    - Which existing services would you say do a good job and why?
    - Which existing services would you say do a bad job and why?
    - How would you envision this project in comparison?
- What are important components of a website for a rental property?
    - What pages should be included?
    - Is there anything that is absolutely essential?
    - Is there anything that should be avoided?
    - Can you give examples of good websites and bad websites?
    - Are there any existing freetobook products that could be included on the generated websites?
        - If yes, do you know what the most commonly used alternatives would be for non-freetobook users?
        - Should these be included alongside the freetobook versions, or should only one option be included on the generated website?

## Conclusion

- Thanks for your time and for answering all my questions. Do you have any questions or advice for me before we wrap up?
- End recording, thank the participant again, and end the meeting
