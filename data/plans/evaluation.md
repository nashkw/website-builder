# Plan for evaluation interviews

## Introduction

- Interview should be casual and open discussion should be encouraged
    - If useful conversation flows naturally this should be explored above sticking to the plan
- At the start of the interview greet the participant and start the recording
- Go over the reason for the interview (evaluation) and reiterate that the participant can ask for a break or withdraw from the interview at any time

## Interview

- How did you find the task?
- Can you walk me through the website you created?
  - What was your reasoning behind each choice (e.g. which page to put information on, how to separate room types, etc).
- How do you feel about the website you created?
  - Does it contain all the information the original website did?
    - If no, what was left out and why?
    - Did you feel this was a problem? Or were there some things that were better left out?
  - Was there anything not included in the original website that you needed to include in the new website?
    - If yes, was this information properties would have or is this information that should be made non-mandatory.
  - How does it compare in terms of look and feel?
  - How do you think properties would feel about it?
  - How do you think potential guests would feel about it?
- How did it feel to use the website building interface?
  - Can you walk me through your workflow when using the interface?
  - Did you find it easy to understand what information was needed for each field?
    - Do you think the fields were appropriate?
  - Did you encounter any problems?
    - If yes, what were they?
    - What attempts did you make to overcome them?
  - Do you have any recommendations for how the interface can be improved?

## Conclusion

- Thanks for your time and for answering all my questions. Do you have any questions or advice for me before we wrap up?
- End recording, thank the participant again, and end the meeting
