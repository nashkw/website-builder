## Data

All data acquired over the course of the project, along with any associated documentation.

### Directory Structure

* `ethics/` ethical documentation for data collected from human subjects
* `plans/` planning documents to prepare for data collection
* `recordings/` interview recordings (this is not stored in version control for privacy reasons)

### Methodologies

* As a part of the requirements gathering process, three interviews with freetobook employees were conducted in weeks 3 and 4. The rough plan for these interviews can be found in `plans/`, the signed consent forms can be found in `ethics/`, and the audio recordings can be found (only locally) in `recordings/`.
